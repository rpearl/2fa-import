This script generates QR codes for every 2FA code in a Google
Authenticator Database.

It works for me; your mileage may vary.

Requires https://pypi.python.org/pypi/qrcode

To export your QR codes as a sqlite3 database, you need root on your
old phone. This lets you import your codes without root on your new
phone. If you have root, you might as well just copy the database over;
this script will be a very roundabout way of doing it.

To grab your codes from your rooted old phone, use:
    adb pull /data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/databases

Then to generate QR codes, use:
    python 2fa-import.py [path-to-pulled-database]
